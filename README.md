# Line-Robot
Custom line robot. A spinning disk with a color sensor will scan the line to follow. The disk itself spins and another sensor tracks the position of the disk using colored pie shaped areas on top of the disk. The Robot is driven by two wheels with encoders. This robot was built and did well in following a line and even where multiple lines crossed.
